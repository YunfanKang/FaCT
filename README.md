# FaCT

The three-phase greedy algorithm for solving the enriched max-p-regions problem.

## Code and Data
1. The repository contains a project that can be imported by the IntelliJ IDEA. 
2. The source code for the GMP implementation is in "src/main/java/edu/ucr/gmp/GMaxP.java". 
3. The data used in the experiments are in the "data" folder. The size of the CA dataset is too big for github, it is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16uiQEX_cKD2d_rcLKj0-0MWy0g5Ql7wk?usp=sharing.

## To run the experiments

The implementation of the FaCT algorithm has been packaged into the GMP.jar package. It is assumed that the data required for the experiments is in the directory ./data. To run the experiments, use the command:
```
java -jar GMP.java
```
The 10 experiments described in the experiment section for the GMP problem will be carried out one by one.

To reproduce the results about the impact of the threshold value and scability for the MP-regions implementation, use the command:
```
java -jar MP.java
```
