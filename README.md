# FaCT

The three-phase greedy algorithm for solving the generalized max-p-regions problem.

## Code and Data
1. The repository contains a project that can be imported by the IntelliJ IDEA. 
2. The source code for the GMP implementation is in "src/main/java/edu/ucr/gmp/GMaxP.java". 
3. The data used in the experiments are in the "data" folder. 

## To run the experiments

The implementation of the FaCT algorithm has been packaged into the GMP.jar package. It is assumed that the data required for the experiments is in the directory ./data. To run the experiment, use the command:
```
java -jar GMP.java
```
The 10 experiments described in the experiment section for the GMP problem will be carried out one by one.
